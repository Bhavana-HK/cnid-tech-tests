# Interview

This is a coding exercise to help us assess candidates looking to join the Infrastructure Engineering team at Cond√© Nast International.  The test is intended to be completed at home, and we expect you to spend about 2 hours on it.  If you haven't finished in that time, you can send us your progress - we don't want you to spend days on this.  We understand that your time is valuable, and appreciate any time that you contribute towards building a strong team here.  If you really cannot spare the time, you may want to take a look at Option 2.

## Option 1

Create a node.js 'Hello World' web application and deploy it to a Cloud Infrastructure, such as an AWS account, using appropriate tools and best practices.  When deployed, the root url should display 'Hello World'. 

### What we are looking for

- That you know what good DevOps principles are.
- We expect you to be able to handle code like a software engineer.
- We anticipate that the app may have future infrastructure requirements, so you should aim for maintainability with your solution.
- Those naughty [Chaos Monkeys](https://github.com/netflix/chaosmonkey) have been known to randomly terminate AWS instances.  Your solution should be resilient to this.
- Members of the team use various OSes and distributions.  It would be great if they could develop the application locally in a consistent environment.
- We want to discover how you handle infrastructure day-to-day.
- Monitoring is great but we don't want you to worry about it for now.
- The same goes for CI servers.


## Option 2

If you have some personal code that you would be prepared to share with us, we can assess that instead.  The code should meet the following criteria:

- It should be your own work.
- Ideally, it should involve an element of web development platform
- It should demonstrate how you approach any particular problem
- It should be something that you are able to discuss with us
- It should cover as many of the points that we are looking for in option 1

## Submission

You can submit your code however you want - send the details to your point of contact.  Please include a README containing any relevant information.
