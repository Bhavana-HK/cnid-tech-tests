# Overview

This is a coding exercise to help us assess candidates looking to join the team at Cond√© Nast International.  The test is intended to be completed at home, and we expect you to spend no more than half a day working it out. We appreciate the time you spent on it and will having it examined by one of our engineer, we will go through your submitted work together when you're invited to meet us face-to-face.        

## Which test shall I pick?
 - [Software Engineer](se-test)
 - [Infrastructure Engineer](infra-test)   

## How to submit code
We prefer to see your work as a GIT repo with commits from which the app is built up.
You can submit by sending up the link to a public git repository on Github, or if for some reason you'd 
like to keep the submission only between us, use [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) and submit the zipped work.

Send the work to your **point of contact**. 

## What we are looking for?
 - The submitted code actually work? (Don't panic if it doesn't, if you could share the reason with us)
 - Do you pay attention to requirements and details?
 - Do you write tests? What's your approach to test the code you write.
 - Do you document stuff you've built, design decisions, how-tos and explain it's scopes and limitations? 
 - We don't expect you to use cutting-edge libraries on the code, consider what fits the purposes.
 - We don't want you to spend hours tweaking pixel.  Keep it simple.
