# Overview
This task is intended for people who interviews our software engineer roles:
 - [Software Engineer](https://condenastuk.avature.net/careers/JobDetail/Software-Engineer/1667)
 - [Senior Software Engineer](https://condenastuk.avature.net/careers/JobDetail/Senior-Software-Engineer/1412) 
 - [Technical Lead Engineer](https://condenastuk.avature.net/careers/JobDetail/Technical-Lead-Software-Engineer/1468) 

Please make sure you read [our expectations](../README.md#What we are looking for?) first before getting down to the following tasks:  

## Option 1

Build a JavaScript application that shows the latest news from the United Kingdom, using the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) service.

Running the app we should be able to see the latest **UK news** and give the ability to the user to filter them by keywords (see [everything endpoint api](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything)). Optionally clicking on a news the user will navigate to an individual article page.

Given the fact that this is a Full Stack challenge, we are expecting a Frontend application and a Backend application that communicate with each other.

A Full Stack developer is someone with familiarity in each layer; you might be stronger on the frontend, or vice-versa. Feel free to focus more on what you know best, be creative and show us your skills!

### Submission

You can submit your code however you want (github/bitbucket/gitlab repo or a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle))- send the details to your point of contact.

Please also include in the README any justifications you wish to mention in relation to your approach or technology choices. You may also add info here on anything you would add to the project if you were to spend further time on it.

### FAQ

Q: Shall I provide my `newsapi.org` token?  
A: Absolutely not. Provide a way we can easily plug it in

Q: What browsers must I support?  
A: Latest Firefox & Chrome. Donâ€™t worry about any browser inconsistencies.

Q: What version of node must I support?  
A: >= 8

Q: Should I deploy the application somewhere it is publicly reachable?
A: No

Q: Can I use transpilers?  
A: Yes, but you [may not need to](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

Q: Can I use libraries, frameworks, etc?  
A: Yes...but please consider the 'What we are looking for?' guidelines.

## Option 2

If you have some existing code that you would be prepared to share with us, we can look at that instead. The code should meet the following criteria:

* It should be at least 1-2 hours of your own work
* Ideally, it should involve an element of web development
* It should demonstrate how you approach a problem
* It should be something that you are able to discuss with us
