# Overview
This task is intended for people who interviews our software engineer roles:
 - [Software Engineer](https://condenastuk.avature.net/careers/JobDetail/Software-Engineer/1667)
 - [Senior Software Engineer](https://condenastuk.avature.net/careers/JobDetail/Senior-Software-Engineer/1412) 
 - [Technical Lead Engineer](https://condenastuk.avature.net/careers/JobDetail/Technical-Lead-Software-Engineer/1468) 

Please make sure you read [our expectations](../README.md#What we are looking for?) first before getting down to the following tasks:  

## Option 1

Build a JavaScript application that shows the latest news from the United Kingdom, using the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) service.

Running the app we should be able to see the latest **UK news** and give the ability to the user to filter them by keywords (see [everything endpoint api](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything)). Optionally clicking on a news the user will navigate to an individual article page.

Given the fact that this is a Full Stack challenge, we are expecting a Frontend application and a Backend application that communicate with each other.

A Full Stack developer is someone with familiarity in each layer; you might be stronger on the frontend, or vice-versa. Feel free to focus more on what you know best, be creative and show us your skills!

### Submission
See ["how to submit your work"](../README.md#how-to-submit-code)

### FAQ

Q: Shall I provide my `newsapi.org` token?

Q: What browsers must I support?  
A: Latest Firefox & Chrome. Donâ€™t worry about any browser inconsistencies.

Q: What version of node must I support?  
A: >= 8

Q: Should I deploy the application somewhere it is publicly reachable?
A: No

Q: Can I use transpilers?  
A: Yes, but you [may not need to](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

Q: Can I use libraries, frameworks, etc?  
A: Yes...but please consider ["What we are looking for?"](../README.md#What we are looking for?) guidelines.

## Option 2

If you have some existing code that you would be prepared to share with us, we can look at that instead. The code should meet the following criteria:

* It should be similar hours of your own work as with Option 1
* Ideally, it should involve an element of web development
* It should demonstrate how you approach a problem
* It should be something that you are able to discuss with us
* It better involves both client and server-side skills
