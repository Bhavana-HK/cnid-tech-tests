This is a coding exercise to help assess candidates looking to join our team at Condé Nast International as Senior Full Stack Developers.

The exercise is intended to be completed at your leisure in around 1-2 hours. It is not timed, so if you finish early or late that's fine too. We aren't looking for perfection, just hoping to get an idea of the way you work.

If you haven't finished in that time, you can send us your progress - we don't want you to spend days on this. We understand that your time is valuable, and appreciate any time that you contribute towards building a strong team here.

If you cannot spare the time, you may want to take a look at Option 2.

## Option 1

Build a JavaScript application that shows the latest news from the United Kingdom, using the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) service.

Running the app we should be able to see the latest **UK news** and give the ability to the user to filter them by keywords (see [everything endpoint api](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything)). Optionally clicking on a news the user will navigate to an individual article page.

Given the fact that this is a Full Stack challenge, we are expecting a Frontend application and a Backend application that communicate with each other.

A Full Stack developer is someone with familiarity in each layer; you might be stronger on the frontend, or vice-versa. Feel free to focus more on what you know best, be creative and show us your skills!

### What we are looking for

* We anticipate that the website may have future requirements, so you should aim for maintainability with your solution
* The JavaScript ecosystem changes quickly, so we like to see knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals
* We want to discover how you write code day-to-day (from the folder structure, testing, naming point of view)
* We don't want you to spend hours tweaking every pixel. Keep it simple.
* Keep it simple (again :) )

### Submission

You can submit your code however you want (github/bitbucket/gitlab repo or a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle))- send the details to your point of contact.

Please also include in the README any justifications you wish to mention in relation to your approach or technology choices. You may also add info here on anything you would add to the project if you were to spend further time on it.

### FAQ

Q: Shall I provide my `newsapi.org` token?  
A: Absolutely not. Provide a way we can easily plug it in

Q: What browsers must I support?  
A: Latest Firefox & Chrome. Don’t worry about any browser inconsistencies.

Q: What version of node must I support?  
A: >= 8

Q: Should I deploy the application somewhere it is publicly reachable?
A: No

Q: Can I use transpilers?  
A: Yes, but you [may not need to](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

Q: Can I use libraries, frameworks, etc?  
A: Yes...but please consider the 'What we are looking for?' guidelines.

## Option 2

If you have some existing code that you would be prepared to share with us, we can look at that instead. The code should meet the following criteria:

* It should be at least 1-2 hours of your own work
* Ideally, it should involve an element of web development
* It should demonstrate how you approach a problem
* It should be something that you are able to discuss with us
